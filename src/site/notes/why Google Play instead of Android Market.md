The name "Google Play" is a deliberate marketing choice that goes beyond just being an "app store."

Here’s the breakdown of why Google chose this name:

### 1. The Original Name Was Literal (And Boring)
When it launched in 2008, it was actually called the **Android Market**. This was a purely functional name that described exactly what it was—a marketplace for Android apps.

### 2. The Big Rebranding in 2012: "Google Play"
In March 2012, Google consolidated several of its digital content stores under one brand. The **Android Market** was merged with:
* **Google Music** (for songs/albums)
* **Google eBookstore** (for books)
* The video rental/purchase section (which later evolved into Google Play Movies & TV)

They needed a new name that encompassed **all** these forms of digital entertainment—not just apps.

### Why "Play"?
The word "Play" was chosen for specific strategic reasons:

* **Broader Concept:** "Play" evokes **entertainment, fun, and leisure**. It suggests movies, music, games, and books—not just utilitarian apps like calculators or file managers. It positioned the store as a destination for **digital lifestyle and entertainment**.
* **Emotional Appeal:** "Market" or "Store" feels transactional and cold. "Play" is warm, inviting, and active. It's about the *experience* you have with the content, not just the act of buying it.
* **Unified Brand:** It created a single, recognizable brand (**Google Play**) for all Google's digital content across phones, tablets, the web, and eventually TVs (Android TV/Google TV).
* **Competitive Positioning:** This was a direct move against Apple's ecosystem. Apple had the **App Store** (for apps) and **iTunes** (for music/movies). Google wanted one umbrella brand that could compete with both, and "Play" served that purpose perfectly.

### Your Analogy is Spot On
You called it a **marketplace/depot**, and in a technical sense, that's its core function. But think of it this way:
* A **"Hardware Store"** sells tools and materials.
* A **"Toy Store"** sells playthings.

Google didn't want to be just the "Android App Hardware Store." They wanted to be the **"Digital Toy Store"** (and movie store, and music store, and book store). The name "Play" signals that shift in identity.

**In summary:** Google renamed it to **Google Play** to transform its image from a simple *app marketplace* into a unified, fun-focused *entertainment and content destination* for the entire Android ecosystem. The name is a marketing strategy to make it feel more expansive and engaging than "Android Market" ever could.
