There is a long run on her black stockings. I mean, these stockings probably can't be worn many more times—even high-quality ones seem to get runs or snags so easily. 

The stockings she's wearing have a run near the upper thigh area (a snag, a small tear mark, but it's spread more than 10cm)—she couldn't have missed noticing this, right? I should remind her—best to change to another pair quickly! 

The ripped black stockings she's wearing exude a deliberate sexiness, with several snag marks that are particularly eye-catching and captivating, making one linger and forget to leave. 

### Relationship and Distinction:

- **Snag** may refer to a small localized pull; if the pulled thread continues to extend, it becomes a **run**.
- The example sentence uses both terms, indicating that the stockings have both small points of damage (snags) and long, extended runs.

### Supplement: Cultural/Aesthetic Implications

> “The ripped black stockings she's wearing exude a deliberate sexiness...”

Here, the damaged stockings are endowed with a deliberate sexual implication. In certain subcultures or fashion styles, "ripped stockings" may carry connotations of rebellion, provocation, or languid beauty.
