### 1. The pronunciation of "th" in "thigh" (voiceless consonant /θ/)

* **Manner of articulation:** This is a "voiceless dental fricative."
* **Key points for articulation:**
 1. Gently place the tip of your tongue between your upper and lower front teeth, or extend it slightly.
 2. Allow air to squeeze through the gap between your tongue and teeth, creating a friction sound.
 3. The vocal cords do not vibrate (you won't feel vibration if you touch your throat).
* **Sensation:** It sounds like gently blowing air, letting the airflow create friction against the teeth and tongue tip. It has a "thin," "frictional" quality.
* **Example words:** **th**igh, **th**in, **th**rough, **Th**ursday

### 2. Difference from "sigh" (s)

* The `s` in "sigh" is the voiceless consonant /s/.
* **Articulation:** The tip of the tongue is close to the alveolar ridge (the bump behind the upper teeth), but does not touch it; air is forced through the narrow gap in the middle. The tongue position is further back than for `th` and does not protrude between the teeth.
* **Key Difference:** When pronouncing `s`, your tongue tip is inside the mouth; when pronouncing `th` (/θ/), your tongue tip is on or between your teeth. The `s` sound is "sharper" and more "hissy."
