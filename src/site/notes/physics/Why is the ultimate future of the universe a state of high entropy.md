### 1. Entropy of Non-Gravitational Systems

In a system without gravity, entropy measures the degree of disorder of [[microscopic state\|microscopic state]]s. For example:
- A deck of cards [neatly arranged by suit and number]: a single [[macroscopic state\|macroscopic state]], few microscopic states → **low entropy**.
- Shuffled into [[random order\|random order]]: macroscopically "disordered," but corresponds to an extremely large number of [microscopic arrangements] → **high entropy**. ([[physics/why high entropy for a shuffled deck\|why high entropy for a shuffled deck]])
- Gas filling a container: [[uniform distribution\|uniform distribution]] corresponds to the maximum number of microscopic states → **high entropy**; concentrated in one corner is very special → **low entropy**.

The intuition here is: uniform, disordered states = high entropy.

### 2. Entropy of Gravitational Systems (The Key to the Universe)

Gravity is a long-range attractive force that [causes matter to tend to cluster] rather than disperse uniformly. Therefore:
- **Uniform Distribution**: For [[self-gravitating system\|self-gravitating system]]s (such as matter in the universe), a [[uniform distribution\|uniform distribution]] is actually [a very special, rare state] because gravity [amplifies any tiny density fluctuations], forming structures like clusters, galaxies, stars, etc. Thus, the number of [[microscopic state\|microscopic state]]s corresponding to a [[uniform distribution\|uniform distribution]] is extremely small → **low entropy**.
- **Clustered State**: When matter clusters under gravity [to form stars, black holes, etc.], the system can be [in many more possible microscopic configurations] (==especially black holes, whose entropy is proportional to the area of their event horizon==), resulting in higher entropy.

Simply put, in a gravity-dominated scenario, uniform = low entropy, clustering = high entropy. 

### 3. Why was the early universe in a low-entropy state?

At the beginning of the Big Bang, the universe was an extremely uniform, dense, and high-temperature "plasma soup." Although [[microscopic particle\|microscopic particle]]s moved vigorously (high temperature), their [[spatial distribution\|spatial distribution]] was highly uniform (confirmed by the uniformity of the cosmic microwave background radiation). For a gravitational system, this uniformity represents [an extremely ordered and highly improbable state], resulting in very low entropy. 

This is precisely a mysterious feature of the universe's birth: why were the initial conditions so low in entropy? (Penrose described this using the "Weyl curvature hypothesis": the entropy of the gravitational field was extremely low at the Big Bang.)

### 4. Why is [the ultimate future of the universe] a state of high entropy?

In the extremely distant future:
- Stars will exhaust their fuel and cease to produce new energy.
- Matter may be swallowed by [[black hole\|black hole]]s, which then slowly evaporate via [[Hawking radiation\|Hawking radiation]].
- Ultimately, the universe may approach a nearly empty, extremely cold, and sparsely populated [[uniform state\|uniform state]].

This state may appear "empty and orderly," but in reality:
- Black holes themselves are celestial bodies of extremely high entropy (for example, [a black hole with the mass of the Sun] has much higher entropy than the Sun itself).
- After a black hole evaporates, entropy does not decrease ([[Hawking radiation\|Hawking radiation]] is [[thermal radiation\|thermal radiation]], and entropy continues to increase).
- [The final uniform, cold, and desolate state] is the [[maximum entropy state\|maximum entropy state]] achievable by a [[gravitational system\|gravitational system]]: matter and radiation are completely dispersed, gravity can no longer form structures, and all [[energy\|energy]] can no longer [[perform work\|perform work]] ([[heat death\|heat death]]).

From the early high uniformity (low gravitational entropy) to the final uniform cold and silent state (high gravitational entropy), the process involves gravitational clustering, stellar burning, black hole formation and evaporation, leading to a significant increase in entropy.
